=========================
(slide 1)

*Introduction*

* Historical outline:
  - Price, 1965, 1976, Milgram, 1967
  - Barabási & Albert, 1999, Watts & Strogatz, 1998
  - Power-law, small-world







=========================
(slide 2)

*Introduction*

* Power-laws
  - p(k) = k^-alpha       (or +alpha)
  - Zipf
  - Pareto
  - Steven's
  - Many other (Gravity..)
  - Scale-free networks













=========================
(slide 3)

*Three egalitarian aspects*

* Power-law <=> uniform distributions

* Networks are not static

* And are not isolated

* Participants change roles along time and along scales
and along networks.
















=========================
(slide 4)

*Hubs boast*

* Literature properties on the hubs:
  - Attack and control of networks
  - Transport and communications
  - Aging of hubs

* Considerations:
  - Hubs are few
  - with trivial behavior
  - Corruption, commitment
  - Peripherals and intermediary give external input
  - Intermediary give structure and are authorities
















=========================
(slide 5)

*Discussion*

* Pressure to legitimate inequality
and concentration as a natural tendency

* Cultures that avoid inequality explicitly

* Heisenberg, Marcuse



















=========================
(slide 5)

*Conclusions*

* Agent-based models

* Survey / text mining

* Evaluation and development of the repported issues
  - Are the ideas sound and relevant?
  - What is missing or can be improoved?

* Study the dinamics of the vertices
  - connectivity, scales, translation

* Study the connectivity of participants within
networks

* Antithesis: formalism and institutionalization might
impose a more stable and less extreme distribution of resources
